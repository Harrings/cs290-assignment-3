Tasks: Read over assignment, as well as setting up new github directory and planning out how to approach part 1.

I had a sereis of Family/Medical Issues during the previous two weeks that lead to me only being able to start part 1 on January 30th and combined with my other class work I was unable to complete assignment 4. I was also away from my main desktop until Feb 1st so I was not able to commit a git until then.
